## Computational Heat Transfer Toolkit

A MATLAB-based **Finite Element Method (FEM) solver** engineered for the analysis of 2D steady-state heat conduction in complex geometries. This toolkit provides a flexible and editable platform for thermal analysis, offering a powerful alternative to traditional black-box solvers.

### Key Features
* **Custom FEM Solver:** Utilizes a custom-built FEM engine to accurately model heat transfer and visualize thermal gradients.
* **Geometry & Boundary Conditions:** Accepts user-defined 2D geometries and provides a straightforward interface for applying custom boundary conditions.
* **Solver Validation:** Compares results against a known analytical solver to validate accuracy and build confidence in the tool's performance.
* **High Editability:** Unlike commercial software, the open-source code allows users to modify the solver's parameters and marching processes for specific, high-precision applications.

### How to Use
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
2.  Open the main script in MATLAB.
3.  Follow the in-script instructions to import geometry and define boundary conditions.

### Future Development
* Expand to 3D analysis.
* Add transient heat transfer capabilities.
* Develop a GUI for improved user experience.
